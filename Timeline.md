# Month 1: Core Programming, Machine Learning, and Mathematics Foundations

## 1. Python Programming (First 2 Weeks)
### Goal:
Achieve fluency in Python, focusing on data manipulation and libraries.

### What to Focus On:
- Core Python: loops, functions, classes, error handling.
- Libraries: 
  - **Numpy**
  - **Pandas**
  - Basic use of **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizations.

### Practice:
- Build basic Python projects to process data (e.g., data cleaning, visualizations).
- Use platforms like **HackerRank** or **LeetCode** to practice Python coding problems.
